# Trading_Alogrithm based on moving average strategies



This algorithm is based on the trading algorithm used during my Algo Trading course at the University of Oxford.

The algo uses the following strategies:

Time-Series Momentum (TSMOM)
Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

Calculation of performance metrics, such as Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, Calmar Ratio, Max Drawdown, etc., and visualizations of cumulative returns and comparisons of strategies.
