# Trading_Alogrithm based on moving average strategies


this algorithm is based on the trading algorithm used during my Algo Trading course at the University of Oxford

The aglo uses following strategies

Time-Series Momentum (TSMOM)
Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

Calculation of performance metrics such as Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, Calmar Ratio, Max Drawdown, etc.
Visualizations of cumulative returns and comparisons of strategies
